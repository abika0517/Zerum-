🍲 ImpactFeed – Food Donation Visibility Platform

📌 Project Overview

ImpactFeed is a **recognition-first web platform** designed to make food donation activities **visible, measurable, and socially acknowledged**.
Instead of managing donations or money, the platform focuses on **highlighting real food relief work** done by NGOs, volunteers, donors, and caterers.

The core idea is that **public recognition and visibility can motivate contributors to participate repeatedly**, strengthening local community food support efforts.

 🎯 Problem Statement

* Many food donation efforts are **short-lived** due to lack of recognition
* Contributors often lose motivation when their efforts are not visible
* NGOs struggle to clearly **demonstrate impact** without extra reporting work
* Existing platforms focus on logistics or fundraising, not visibility

---

💡 Solution

ImpactFeed provides a **LinkedIn-style public impact feed** where food donation activities are posted with verified details and contributor recognition.

* NGOs and volunteers post food donation activities
* Contributors are tagged using **consent-based public recognition**
* Activities appear in a shared public feed
* Impact metrics are automatically aggregated

This approach uses **visibility as an incentive**, encouraging sustained participation without financial transactions.
